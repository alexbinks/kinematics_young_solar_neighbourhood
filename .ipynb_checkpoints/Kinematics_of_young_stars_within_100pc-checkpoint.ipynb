    "#### Two years ago I led a Gaia DR2-based project to map the kinematics of young stars within the nearest 100pc. The ~200 Li-rich (so definitely young) FGK-type stars were selected from kinematically-unbiased \"wide-angle\" surveys, meaning we could identify young stars that do not belong to groups, or maybe even find new groups altogether!\n",
